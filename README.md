# bubbleSynth
NOTE: This can't work with tauri atm as they have problems with js workers, I've asked everywhere and there's no way around it. More on the last entry of the dev diary.


This is intended to be a fully fledged modular synthesizer made in tauri, with an intuitive interface and "hidden" commands for building fast patches.
